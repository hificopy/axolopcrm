# SECTION 3: THE CORE FOUR EXECUTION

## Daily Actions Required

### Channel 1: WARM OUTREACH (50/day)

**Script for LinkedIn DMs:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question — do you know any agency owners
drowning in SaaS subscriptions?

We just helped [mutual connection/similar person]
cut their tool spend from $1,500/mo to $279/mo.

If anyone comes to mind, I'd love an intro.
And if that's you... happy to show you how.

— Juan
```

**Script for Past Customers/Colleagues:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Hope you're crushing it. Quick favor:

I'm looking for agency owners who are:
- Paying too much for tools that don't talk to each other
- Tired of Zapier breaking at 2am
- Ready to consolidate their stack

Know anyone?

If you send them my way and they sign up,
I'll give you $500 (or donate it to your favorite charity).

Thanks!
Juan
```

**Script for Content Engagers:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw you liked my post about [topic].

Curious — are you dealing with that right now?

If so, I might have something that helps. No pitch, just context.

— Juan
```

### Channel 2: FREE CONTENT (2-3/day per account)

**Content Ratio:**
- 80% pure value (no product mention)
- 20% product-related (soft CTA)

**Daily Posting Schedule:**

| Time | Platform | Account | Content Type |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 8am | Twitter | @juansbiz | Personal/educational |
| 10am | Twitter | @axolopcrm | Hot take/controversial |
| 12pm | Instagram | @juansbiz | Reel or carousel |
| 2pm | LinkedIn | Juan | Long-form post |
| 4pm | TikTok | @axolopcrm | Funny/viral attempt |
| 6pm | Twitter | @axolopcrm | Engagement post |

### Channel 3: COLD OUTREACH (50/day)

**The 3C Framework Applied:**

**LinkedIn Cold DM:**
```
Hey [Name],

Compliment: Saw your post about [specific thing].
Really resonated — especially the part about [detail].

Credibility: We help [their industry] agencies
close 30% more deals while cutting tool spend by 80%.

CTA: Open to a 2-min video showing how?
No call required, just a quick Loom.

— Juan
```

**Instagram Cold DM:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Love what you're building at [company].

Quick question: how many tools are you using
to run your agency right now?

Asking because we just helped someone go from
12 tools ($1,800/mo) to 1 tool ($279/mo).

Curious if that's a problem for you too.
```

**Cold Email:**
```
Subject: [Company Name] — quick question

Hey [Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their business].

Question: How many SaaS tools are you paying for right now?

Most agency owners I talk to are at 8-12 tools,
spending $1,200-2,000/month.

We help them consolidate to one platform at $279/mo —
saving $13k+/year.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits?

No pressure either way.

— Juan
Founder, Axolop CRM

P.S. Here's a 2-min video of how it works: [Loom link]
```

### Channel 4: PAID ADS (When Ready)

**Hook → Agitate → Solve → CTA Framework:**

**Ad Script 1: "The $47k Mistake"**
```
HOOK (0-3 sec):
[Face to camera, casual setting]
"I lost $47,000 because I forgot to follow up with a lead."

AGITATE (3-15 sec):
"And the worst part? I had the lead in my CRM.
But my CRM was one of 10 tools I was using.
I forgot to check it. Competitor closed the deal.
$47k gone. Just like that."

SOLVE (15-30 sec):
"So I built something different.
One platform. Everything connected.
AI that reminds you before you forget.
Writes the follow-up emails for you.
$279/month. Not $1,500."

CTA (30-37 sec):
"Link below for a free trial.
Set up in 5 minutes.
Close your first deal by tomorrow.
Or don't. Keep paying HubSpot."
```

**Ad Script 2: "The SaaS Addiction"**
```
HOOK (0-3 sec):
[Counting on fingers, stressed look]
"GoHighLevel. ClickUp. Notion. HubSpot. Calendly.
Typeform. Zapier. Slack. That's $1,500 a month."

AGITATE (3-15 sec):
"And none of them talk to each other.
So you're copying data between tabs.
Paying for Zapier to break at 2am.
Onboarding new hires to 10 different tools.
This is insane."

SOLVE (15-30 sec):
"We built Axolop.
CRM, projects, forms, email, calendar, AI — all connected.
$279/month. That's it.
Average customer saves $13,000 a year."

CTA (30-37 sec):
"Free trial. No credit card.
Set up in 5 minutes.
Link below.
Your accountant will thank you."
```

```

```

### Email 3: Day 3 — AI System

Juan
```

### Email 4: Day 5 — Case Study
**Subject:** She went from 5 deals/month to 15
```
Hey {first_name},

Quick story:

Sarah ran a 4-person marketing agency.
She was using: GoHighLevel, ClickUp, Notion, Calendly, Mailchimp.
Total cost: $847/month.
Deals closed: 5/month average.

She switched to Axolop.
Total cost: $279/month.
Deals closed (90 days later): 15/month.

What changed?
1. All her data in one place (no more tab switching)
2. AI follow-ups (no more forgotten leads)
3. 6 hours/week saved (more time for actual sales)

Full case study here: [link]

You're on the same path.

Juan
```

### Email 5: Day 7 — Check-In
**Subject:** How's your first week?
```
Hey {first_name},

It's been a week. Quick check-in:

1. Did you import your leads?
2. Did you send your first follow-up?
3. Any questions I can answer?

Reply with a number:
1 = Crushing it, no help needed
2 = Going well, have a few questions
3 = Stuck, need help
4 = Haven't started yet (no judgment)

Whatever your answer, I'm here.

Juan

P.S. If you picked 4, that's okay.
Reply and I'll personally walk you through setup on a call.
```

## Sequence 2: Nurture (Non-Converters)

### Email 1: Day 1 After Trial Ends
**Subject:** Your tools are talking about you
```
Hey {first_name},

I noticed you didn't convert to paid.

No hard feelings. But I'm curious:

Was it the price? (We have annual plans that save 20%)
Was it the features? (Tell me what's missing)
Was it timing? (We'll be here when you're ready)
Was it something else? (I genuinely want to know)

Reply with what held you back.

I read every response.

Juan
```

### Email 2: Day 4 — ROI Math
**Subject:** Let's do the math real quick
```
Hey {first_name},

Quick math problem:

Your current tool spend (estimated): $1,200-1,500/month
Axolop: $279/month
Difference: $921-1,221/month
Annual savings: $11,052-14,652

What could you do with an extra $13k/year?
- Hire a part-time VA
- Run paid ads for 6 months
- Take an actual vacation
- All of the above

Just saying.

Link to restart your trial: [link]

Juan
```

### Email 3: Day 7 — Breakup
**Subject:** Should I stop emailing you?
```
Hey {first_name},

I've sent you a few emails. You haven't responded.

I get it. Inbox is busy. Priorities shift.

But I don't want to be that annoying founder
who won't stop emailing.

So here's the deal:

Reply "STOP" and I'll never email you again.
Reply "LATER" and I'll check back in 30 days.
Reply "READY" and I'll send you a special offer.

No reply = I'll assume you're busy and
send one more email next week.

Either way, no hard feelings.

Juan
```

# SECTION 6: CONTENT SWIPE FILE

## Ready-to-Post Tweets

### Hot Takes (Post Monday/Friday)

**Tweet 1:**
```
Unpopular opinion:

GoHighLevel is just HubSpot for people
who think they're too cool for HubSpot.

Same problem. Different logo.
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The SaaS industry's best kept secret:

They WANT you to need 10 tools.

Because 10 subscriptions = 10x revenue.

You're not a customer. You're a hostage.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Hot take:

If your CRM needs a consultant to set up,
it's not a product.

It's a consulting business that sells software on the side.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Agencies in 2020: "Let's try GoHighLevel"
Agencies in 2021: "Let's add ClickUp"
Agencies in 2022: "Let's add Notion"
Agencies in 2023: "Let's add more Zapier"
Agencies in 2024: "Why is our tech stack $2k/month?"
Agencies in 2025: *discovers Axolop*
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Controversial:

Most CRM companies don't want you to close more deals.

They want you to LOG more deals.

Big difference.
```

### Educational Threads (Post Tuesday)

**Thread 1: "The $13k Math"**
```
Most agency owners are throwing away $13,152/year.

Here's the exact math (and how to fix it):

🧵 Thread:

---

The average agency tech stack:

• CRM: $400/mo
• Project management: $75/mo
• Knowledge base: $30/mo
• Email marketing: $300/mo
• Forms: $50/mo
• Scheduling: $30/mo
• Automation: $200/mo
• Reporting: $100/mo

Total: $1,185/month

---

But wait, there's more.

None of these tools connect natively.

So you also need:
• Zapier: $150/mo
• Make: $50/mo
• Custom dev work: $???

Real total: $1,400-1,800/month

---

The hidden costs nobody talks about:

• Context switching: 6+ hours/week
• Data entry duplication: 3+ hours/week
• Training new hires: 20+ hours
• "Where is that file?" moments: Daily

Time is money. This costs more than the subscriptions.

---

The consolidation math:

Old way: $1,500/month × 12 = $18,000/year
New way: $279/month × 12 = $3,348/year

Difference: $14,652/year

That's a salary. That's growth capital. That's freedom.

---

What to do about it:

1. Audit every tool you're paying for
2. List what each tool actually does (be honest)
3. Ask: "Could one platform do this?"
4. Calculate your real monthly spend
5. Make the switch

---

We built Axolop because I was spending $1,847/month on tools.

Now it's $279.

One platform. Everything connected. No Zapier needed.

Link in bio if you want to see it.

/end
```

### Relatable Pain Points (Post Wednesday)

**Tweet 6:**
```
Me: "I'll just quickly check the CRM"

*opens HubSpot*
*forgot password*
*resets password*
*2FA on phone*
*phone is dead*
*finds charger*
*finally logs in*
*forgot why I opened it*

The "quick check" took 20 minutes.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Client: "Can you send me the project status?"

Me: *opens ClickUp*
Me: *opens Notion*
Me: *opens Google Docs*
Me: *opens Slack*
Me: *opens email*
Me: *opens Dropbox*

"Give me 45 minutes"
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
The 5 stages of SaaS grief:

1. Denial: "We only use a few tools"
2. Anger: "Why is Zapier broken AGAIN"
3. Bargaining: "Maybe one more integration will fix it"
4. Depression: *stares at $1,500 monthly bill*
5. Acceptance: "Fine, I'll consolidate"
```

### Product Flexes (Post Thursday)

**Tweet 9:**
```
Features we include for free that others charge extra for:

✓ AI email writer
✓ Form builder
✓ Meeting scheduler
✓ Email marketing
✓ White-label reports
✓ Client portal
✓ Knowledge base
✓ Workflow automation

Features we charge extra for:

Nothing.
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
Just shipped:

AI that reads your past emails and
writes follow-ups in YOUR voice.

Not generic ChatGPT garbage.
Actually sounds like you.

This is included. Not an add-on.
Not an extra $99/month.

Just included.
```

### Memes/Unhinged (Post Friday)

**Tweet 11:**
```
Salesforce: "We're enterprise-grade"

Translation: "You'll need 3 consultants and 6 months to send an email"
```

**Tweet 12:**
```
*agency owner wakes up at 3am*

"Did I follow up with that lead?"

*checks 4 different apps*

"Which app was it in again?"

*falls back asleep*

*loses deal*

This is why we built Axolop.
```

*scrolls through subscriptions*

"HubSpot... $500

Calendly... $30
Mailchimp... $100
Typeform... $50
Zapier... $200

"Savings: $9,132"

```

## Video 2: "The Breakup" (45 sec)
```
[Sitting at laptop, emotional music]

"Dear HubSpot,

We need to talk.

It's not me. It's definitely you.

You charge $500/month and you can't even
remember my customer's birthday.

I've met someone new.

They do everything you do.

For $279.

And they actually... work.

Don't call me.

Goodbye."

*closes laptop*
*single tear*

[Text on screen: @axolopcrm]
```

## Video 3: "The Intervention" (60 sec)
```
[Group of friends sitting in circle]

FRIEND 1: "[Name], we need to talk"

YOU: "What's going on?"

FRIEND 2: "It's about your... subscriptions"

YOU: "My what?"

FRIEND 1: *holds up credit card statement*
"47 SaaS subscriptions. $1,800 a month."

YOU: "I need them for work!"

FRIEND 3: "You have THREE project management tools"

YOU: "They do different things!"

FRIEND 2: "Do they though?"

YOU: "..."

FRIEND 1: *slides phone across table*
"This is Axolop. It does everything. $279."

YOU: *starts crying*
"I've been living a lie"

# SECTION 10: METRICS THAT MATTER

## Leading Indicators (Check Daily)

- Outreach messages sent
- Content engagement rate
- DM conversations started
- Website traffic
- Email open/click rates

## Lagging Indicators (Check Weekly)

- Trial signups
- Paid conversions
- MRR growth
- Churn rate
- Customer LTV

## The Only Metric That Matters

**LTV:CAC Ratio**

Target: 3:1 minimum (every $1 spent returns $3)

Formula:
- LTV = Average customer lifespan (months) × $279
- CAC = Total marketing spend ÷ New customers acquired

If LTV:CAC > 3:1 → Scale aggressively
If LTV:CAC = 2-3:1 → Optimize
If LTV:CAC < 2:1 → Stop and fix

# FINAL WORD

## The CMO Mindset

```
Volume beats perfection.
100 okay posts > 10 perfect posts.
100 DMs > waiting for the "right time."
Ship fast. Learn fast. Iterate fast.

The goal isn't to be liked.
The goal is to be KNOWN.
Then TRUSTED.
Then PAID.

Every day:
- 50 warm outreach
- 50 cold outreach
- 2-3 content pieces
- 100% reply rate on comments/DMs

Do this for 100 days.
You will not fail.
It's mathematically impossible.

Now go execute.
```
