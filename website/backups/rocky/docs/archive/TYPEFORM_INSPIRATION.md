# Axolop CRM - Forms Builder: TypeForm Inspiration & Implementation

## Inspiration from TypeForm

TypeForm stands out from traditional CRM and form builders by prioritizing user experience, interactivity, and conversational design, making forms feel more like engaging conversations than static data entry tasks.
