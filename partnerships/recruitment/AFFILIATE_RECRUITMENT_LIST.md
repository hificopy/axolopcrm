## Outreach Scripts

### Script 1: YouTube/Content Creator (Warm)

**Subject:** Quick question about your [Video Title] video

Hey [Name],

I just watched your video on [specific topic] - loved the part about [specific detail].

Quick question: have you tried Axolop CRM yet?

I ask because I know you cover [CRM/agency tools/business systems], and I think your audience would find this interesting:

- It's basically GoHighLevel but $310/month cheaper ($187 vs $497)
- Does everything most agencies need (CRM, calendar, forms, email, automation)
- 14-day free trial, no credit card

We're building our affiliate program and offering:
- 40% recurring commissions (lifetime)
- Up to $72,100 in milestone bonuses
- Custom landing pages and co-branded content

Would you be open to a quick demo? I can show you the product and we can see if it's a fit for your audience.

No pressure either way - I genuinely think your community would benefit from knowing about it.

Axolop Partnerships

P.S. - [Reference something specific they mentioned recently to show you actually follow them]

### Script 2: Agency Owner (Cold)

**Subject:** Question about your tech stack

Hi [Name],

Running [Agency Name] means you're probably paying for at least 5-7 different software tools right now.

Quick question: what's your monthly software bill?

I ask because I've been helping agencies consolidate their tool stacks and save $800-1,200/month. The tool is called Axolop CRM - it replaces:

- Your CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Calendar/scheduling (Calendly)
- Forms (Typeform)
- Email marketing (ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp)
- Project management (ClickUp, Monday)
- Automation (Zapier workflows)

All for $187-349/month depending on the plan.

Beyond using it yourself, there's also an affiliate program (40% recurring commissions) if you ever recommend tools to other agency owners.

Worth a 15-minute demo to see if it fits?

[Your Name]

### Script 3: Course Creator/Educator (Partnership Focus)

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity for [Course Name]

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Course Name] and love what you're building for [target audience].

I run partnerships at Axolop CRM, and I think there's a strong fit here.

**Why it matters for your students:**
Most [agency owners/consultants/entrepreneurs] you train are paying $1,000+/month for fragmented tool stacks. Axolop consolidates everything (CRM, calendar, forms, email, automation) for $187/month.

**Why it matters for you:**
- 40% recurring commissions (lifetime of customer)
- Average affiliate earns $3K-8K/month within 6 months
- We provide all marketing materials, landing pages, and support
- Your students get better results with integrated tools

**What I'm proposing:**
1. I give you a free account to test the product
2. If you like it, we set up an affiliate partnership
3. We create custom materials for your audience
4. Optional: We sponsor a module in your course

Would you be open to a quick call to explore this?

### Script 4: Industry Influencer (Value-First)

**Subject:** [Industry] CRM that actually works

Hi [Name],

I've been following your content on [specific topic] - really helpful stuff for [industry] professionals.

I wanted to reach out because I've seen a lot of [real estate agents/insurance agents/contractors/etc.] struggle with their CRM setup. Either they're overpaying for enterprise tools or using consumer stuff that doesn't scale.

We built Axolop CRM specifically for service businesses:
- Pipeline management for deals
- Calendar/scheduling built-in
- Follow-up automation
- Client communication tracking
- AI lead scoring

And it's $187/month instead of the $300-500 most [industry] CRMs charge.

Two offers:

1. **For you personally:** Free trial, happy to give you a walkthrough specific to [industry] workflows

2. **For your audience:** We have an affiliate program (40% recurring) if you ever want to recommend it

Either way, I think your community would benefit from knowing this exists.

Thoughts?

### Script 5: Blogger/Review Site (SEO Opportunity)

**Subject:** Axolop CRM - new player worth reviewing

Hi [Name],

I manage partnerships at Axolop CRM - we're a newer entrant in the all-in-one CRM space, competing with GoHighLevel and HubSpot.

I noticed you write about [CRM/business tools/agency tech], and I think our product would be worth a review.

**Quick pitch:**
- All-in-one platform (CRM, calendar, forms, email, automation)
- $187-349/month (significantly cheaper than competitors)
- Built for agencies and service businesses
- Strong AI features (lead scoring, transcription)

**What I can offer:**
- Extended free trial for review purposes
- Interview with our founder
- Exclusive data/insights for your article
- Affiliate partnership (40% recurring) if you want to monetize

This would make a great comparison piece: "Axolop vs GoHighLevel" or "Best GHL Alternatives 2025" - keywords with good search volume.

Would you be interested in taking a look?

Just floating this back up - I know you're busy.

Quick version: Axolop CRM is saving agencies $800-1,200/month by replacing their fragmented tool stacks with one platform.

40% recurring affiliate commissions if you want to recommend it.

15 minutes to demo - worth it?
