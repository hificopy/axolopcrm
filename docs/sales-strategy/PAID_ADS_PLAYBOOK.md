**S** - Solution (Present Axolop)
**O** - Offer (CTA with urgency)

### The 3-Second Rule

You have 3 seconds to stop the scroll. Front-load the most painful/interesting part.

### Ad Type 3: The Direct Response Ad

**Format:** Carousel Images

**Image 1:**
```
Headline: "Your CRM is costing you deals."
Subhead: "Here's the math."
```

**Image 2:**
```
Average agency loses 2-3 deals/month to poor follow-up.

At $10k average deal size = $20-30k/month lost.

That's $240-360k/year.

Because of missed calls and forgotten emails.
```

**Image 3:**
```
Axolop AI makes sure you never miss a follow-up:

✅ Lead scoring (know who to call)
✅ Auto-reminders (before deals go cold)
✅ Email writer (AI writes for you)
✅ Mobile app (work anywhere)
```

**Image 4:**
```
What if you recovered just 2 of those lost deals per month?

$20k/month × 12 = $240k/year

For $99/month.

That's a 2,424% ROI.
```

**Script:**
```
[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
"What's up everyone. In this video I'm going to show you the exact CRM I use to close 30% more deals.

Not a theory. Not a promise. Actually showing you the dashboard.

If you run an agency, do sales, or just want to stop losing deals to poor follow-up... stay tuned.

Let me share my screen."

[DEMO - 0:30-3:00]
"So this is Axolop. First thing you see is the dashboard.

Here's my pipeline. [Show pipeline]

See these numbers? That's the AI lead scoring. This lead is a 94 - super hot. This one's a 23 - needs nurturing.

I know exactly who to call first.

Now watch this. [Click on lead]

The AI analyzed this lead's behavior and is telling me: 'This lead opened your email 3 times. They're ready. Call now.'

That's not me guessing. That's data.

And here's my favorite part. [Show email composer]

See this button? 'AI Write.'

I click it, tell it what I need: 'Write a follow-up for a prospect who went silent after pricing.'

[AI generates email]

Done. 5 seconds. Better than I could write.

I've closed deals specifically because the AI wrote a better email than I would have."

[RESULTS - 3:00-4:00]
"Since switching to Axolop, here's what happened:

- I went from closing 8 deals/month to 12 deals/month
- That's a 50% increase
- I save about 10 hours per week
- I'm paying $99/month instead of $1,200

And the best part? I don't lose deals to poor follow-up anymore.

The AI literally won't let me forget."

[CTA - 4:00-4:30]
"If you want to try Axolop, link's in the description.
