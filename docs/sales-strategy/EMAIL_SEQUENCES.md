Quick check-in.

### Email 3: Value Story (Day 3)

**Subject:** He lost $47,000 because he forgot to call

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Let me tell you about Marcus.

Marcus runs a marketing agency. Good at what he does. Makes decent money.

Last year, he met a prospect at a conference. Perfect fit. Six-figure deal on the table.

They shook hands. Exchanged cards. Marcus said, "I'll call you Monday."

Monday came. Marcus got busy. A client emergency. Then another. Then he just... forgot.

Two weeks later, he remembered. Called the prospect.

"Oh hey Marcus. Yeah, I actually signed with someone else last week. You never called back."

$47,000. Gone. Because he forgot to follow up.

**That's exactly why I built Axolop.**

Our AI-powered reminder system makes sure that NEVER happens to you:

- AI scores your leads so you know who to call first
- Automatic follow-up reminders (so you never forget)
- Email templates so you don't stare at a blank screen
- Mobile app so you can work from anywhere

Marcus is a real user now. He hasn't lost a deal to poor follow-up since.

Don't be the Marcus from before. Be the Marcus from after.

P.S. - How many deals have YOU lost because you forgot to follow up? Reply and tell me. I'm curious.

### Email 4: Overcome Objection #1 - "I'm Too Busy" (Day 5)

**Subject:** "I don't have time to learn a new CRM"

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

I hear this a lot: "I don't have time to learn a new CRM right now."

I get it. You're busy. Another tool = more work, right?

Here's the thing...

**You don't have time NOT to use Axolop.**

Let me show you the math:

⏰ Time you spend looking for contact info: 30 min/day
⏰ Time writing follow-up emails from scratch: 45 min/day
⏰ Time switching between apps: 20 min/day
⏰ Time lost to forgotten follow-ups: ???

**That's 1.5+ hours/day wasted.** Plus the deals you're losing.

With Axolop:

✅ All contacts in one place: 0 min searching
✅ AI writes your emails: 5 min instead of 45
✅ One app, not ten: 0 min switching
✅ Never forget follow-up: 0 deals lost

**Net time saved: 10+ hours/week.**

Still think you don't have time?

[Set Up Axolop in 5 Minutes →]

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - What would you do with 10 extra hours every week? Reply and tell me.
```

### Email 5: Social Proof (Day 7)

**Subject:** What 1,000+ agencies see that you might be missing

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

You've been in Axolop for a week now.

Some users at this point have already:
- Closed their first deal
- Set up automated follow-ups
- Migrated from their old CRM

Others haven't logged in since Day 1.

Which one are you?

Here's what agencies using Axolop are saying:

---

"Closed $47k more in 3 months after switching from GoHighLevel. The AI lead scoring alone was worth it."
— Sarah M., Marketing Agency

"Went from 5 deals/month to 15 deals/month in 60 days. I was skeptical of the AI, but it actually works."
— Mike R., Real Estate Agent

"I save 10+ hours per week on admin. Finally working ON my business instead of IN it."
— Jennifer L., Business Consultant

"Replaced 8 different tools. My team was confused at first, but after 1 week they refused to go back."
— David K., Insurance Agency

---

These aren't made up. These are real people, just like you.

The only difference? They took action.

Your trial has 7 days left. Time to decide: are you going to be a success story?

[Activate Your Account →]

P.S. - Need help? I'll personally jump on a 15-min call and set up your account with you. Just reply "HELP ME" and I'll send you my calendar.
```

### Email 6: Overcome Objection #2 - "Too Expensive" (Day 9)

**Subject:** Is Axolop "too expensive"? Let's do the math.

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Some people look at Axolop pricing and think: "$99/month? That's expensive."

Let's do some quick math together.

**What you're probably paying now:**

| Tool | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| GoHighLevel | $497 |
| Calendly | $97 |
| ClickUp | $50 |
| Notion | $30 |
| Typeform | $100 |
| Other tools | $200+ |
| **TOTAL** | **$974+/month** |

**Axolop Revenue Accelerator:** $99/month

**You save:** $875/month = $10,500/year

---

But let's go deeper.

**What's ONE lost deal worth to you?**

If your average deal is $5,000...
And Axolop helps you close just ONE more deal per month...
That's $5,000 extra revenue.

For $99.

That's a **5,000% ROI.**

---

Now, what if Axolop helps you close 30% MORE deals?

If you're closing 10 deals/month now...
30% more = 3 extra deals...
At $5,000 each = $15,000/month more revenue.

For $99.

---

Still think it's "too expensive"?

Here's my guarantee: **Close 30% more deals in 90 days or we work for free until you do.**

We only win when YOU win.

[Upgrade to Revenue Accelerator →]

P.S. - What's your average deal size? Reply and tell me - I'll calculate your exact ROI potential.

### Email 7: Scarcity (Day 11)

**Subject:** Only 7 founding member spots left at $99

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Quick update on something important.

When we launched the Revenue Accelerator tier, we offered founding member pricing at $99/month.

We only had 50 spots at this price.

**43 are gone.**

**7 spots remaining.**

Once they're gone, the price goes to $149/month. No exceptions.

If you've been on the fence, this is your moment.

**What you get at $99/month:**
- 15 team seats
- 5 agencies
- 10,000 leads
- AI Second Brain
- AI Lead Scoring
- AI Email Writer
- 52 Email Templates ($500 value)
- Done-For-You Migration ($2,000 value)
- 90-Day Onboarding ($1,500 value)
- Private Mastermind Community
- Weekly Training Calls

**Total value: $6,600+**
**Your price: $99/month**

And our guarantee: Close 30% more deals in 90 days or we work for free.

[Claim Your Founding Member Spot →]

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - I genuinely don't know how long these spots will last. We've been getting 10+ signups/day. This email goes to 500 people. Do the math.
```

---

### Email 8: Urgency (Day 13 - Trial Ends Tomorrow)

**Subject:** Your trial ends tomorrow, {{first_name}}

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Tomorrow at midnight, your Axolop trial expires.

Here's what happens:
- You lose access to your pipeline
- Your contacts stay locked
- The AI features turn off
- All your setup work disappears

I don't want that for you.

You signed up because you wanted to close more deals. You wanted to stop losing opportunities. You wanted to work smarter.

That's still true, right?

Here's what I can do for you:

**If you upgrade TODAY, I'll personally extend your founding member pricing - even if the 50 spots are gone.**

That's $99/month instead of $149/month. Forever.

But only if you upgrade TODAY.

[Upgrade Now - Keep Your $99/month Rate →]

Not ready to upgrade? Reply and tell me why. I'll see what I can do.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - This is the last email before your trial ends. Whatever's holding you back - price, features, timing - just reply. Let's figure it out together.
```

---

### Email 9: Last Chance (Day 14 - Trial Day)

**Subject:** [FINAL] Your access expires in 6 hours

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

6 hours.

That's all you have left on your Axolop trial.

After that, your pipeline goes dark.

Look - I'm not going to pressure you. You're an adult. You make your own decisions.

But I want you to think about something:

**A year from now, you'll either have:**

**Option A:** A CRM that actually works
- Deals closing on autopilot
- AI handling your follow-ups
- $875/month saved on other tools
- 10+ hours/week back

**Option B:** The same problems you have today
- Forgetting to follow up
- Losing deals to competitors
- Paying for 10 different apps
- Working IN your business instead of ON it

The only difference between these two futures?

What you do in the next 6 hours.

[Keep Your Axolop Access →]

Whatever you decide, I respect it.

But if you let this expire, please don't come back in 6 months saying "I should have done this sooner."

Because I warned you.

{{sender_name}}
```

---

### Email 10: Break-Up Email (Day 16 - Post Trial Expiration)

**Subject:** Should I delete your account?

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Your trial expired 2 days ago.

Your data is still here. Your pipeline is still set up. Everything's ready.

But you haven't come back.

I have two questions:

1. **What happened?** (Just curious)
2. **Should I delete your account?**

If you're done with Axolop, just reply "DELETE" and I'll remove everything.

If you want to come back, reply "EXTEND" and I'll give you 7 more days to decide. No strings attached.

No response? I'll assume you're not interested and move on.

Either way - no hard feelings.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - This email gets 40% response rate. People who were "too busy" suddenly find time. Because they realize what they're about to lose.
```

### Email 2: Quick Win (Day 1)

**Subject:** Your first task: import 100 contacts (2 min)

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Day 1. Let's get a quick win.

Your mission: Import your first 100 contacts.

**Why this matters:**
- Empty CRMs feel useless
- Full CRMs feel valuable
- The faster you populate it, the faster you'll USE it

**How to do it (2 minutes):**

1. Export contacts from your current CRM/spreadsheet
2. Click "Import" in Axolop
3. Map the columns
4. Done

Or, if you have Gmail connected, we'll auto-import your contacts for you.

[Go Import Your Contacts →]

Can't figure it out? Your onboarding specialist will do it for you on your call.

P.S. - 91% of users who import 100+ contacts in Week 1 are still active 6 months later. Be in that 91%.
```

### Email 3: Build Your Pipeline (Day 3)

**Subject:** Build your $1M pipeline in 10 minutes

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Time to build your money-making machine.

Your pipeline is where deals live. It's where you see who's hot, who's cold, and who needs attention.

**Here's your 10-minute pipeline setup:**

1. **Define your stages** (We have templates, or customize)
   - Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed

2. **Set deal values** (Every deal should have a number)
   - If you don't know, estimate. Better than $0.

3. **Add your current deals** (Move them from your head to the screen)
   - Start with your hottest 10 opportunities

4. **Set up deal alerts** (Never forget a follow-up)
   - Stale deal warnings
   - Follow-up reminders

[Build Your Pipeline Now →]

Once your pipeline is set up, Axolop's AI starts working for you:
- Lead scoring to prioritize who to call
- Smart reminders when deals go cold
- Email templates tailored to each stage

This is where the magic happens.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - Stuck on pipeline stages? Reply and tell me your business type. I'll send you a template.

### Email 4: AI Feature Unlock (Day 5)

**Subject:** Unlock your AI superpowers

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

You've got the basics down. Time to activate the AI.

**Your Revenue Accelerator includes:**

1. **AI Lead Scoring** - Know exactly who to call first
2. **AI Email Writer** - Never stare at a blank screen again
3. **AI Second Brain** - Your private knowledge base that learns

Here's how to use each one:

---

**AI Lead Scoring** (Auto-enabled)

Based on your leads' behavior, our AI scores them 1-100.

High score = hot lead, call them NOW
Low score = cold lead, nurture them

[Check Your Lead Scores →]

---

**AI Email Writer**

Next time you need to write a follow-up, click "AI Write" in the email composer.

Tell it: "Write a follow-up for a prospect who went silent after seeing our pricing"

Watch it write a perfect email in 5 seconds.

[Try AI Email Writer →]

---

**AI Second Brain**

This is your private knowledge base.

Upload documents, notes, call recordings.

The AI learns from them. Ask it questions like:
- "What objections did we hear most last quarter?"
- "What's our best performing email subject line?"
- "Summarize our top 5 closed deals this month"

[Activate Second Brain →]

---

These features are what separate $99/month from $997/month enterprise tools.

Use them.

P.S. - The AI gets smarter the more you use Axolop. Feed it data. Watch it learn.

### Email 5: 30-Day Check-In (Day 30)

## SEQUENCE 3: LOST DEAL RECOVERY

**Trigger:** User cancels or trial expires without purchase
**Goal:** Recover the lost opportunity

---

### Email 1: Immediate Post-Cancellation (Day 0)

**Subject:** You're out - but your data stays

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

I saw that you cancelled your Axolop account.

No hard feelings. Business is business.

But I'm curious: **what happened?**

Was it:
- [ ] Too expensive
- [ ] Too complicated
- [ ] Missing features
- [ ] Switched to competitor
- [ ] Just not a priority right now
- [ ] Something else

Just reply with a letter (A, B, C, D, E, or F) and I'll know.

**Also important:** Your data is safe. We keep it for 90 days.

If you change your mind, everything will still be there.

Thanks for trying us.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - If it was price, reply and let me know your budget. I might be able to work something out.
```

---

### Email 2: Value Reminder (Day 7)

**Subject:** Are you still losing deals?

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

A week ago, you left Axolop.

I'm not here to sell you. I'm here to ask a question:

**Are you still losing deals because of poor follow-up?**

If the answer is yes, nothing has changed.

If the answer is no, you found a solution. Great.

But if you're still:
- Forgetting to call prospects back
- Using spreadsheets that don't talk to each other
- Paying for 10 apps when one would do
- Working 60+ hours when you could work 40

...then maybe leaving was the wrong decision.

Your account is still here. Your data is still here. Nothing has been deleted.

[Come Back to Axolop →]

If you come back in the next 48 hours, I'll honor whatever pricing you had before. Even if it's gone up.

Just reply "I'M BACK" and I'll set it up.

```

### Email 3: FOMO Trigger (Day 30)

**Subject:** What our users closed this month (and you didn't)

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

It's been 30 days since you left Axolop.

Here's what our users accomplished this month:

📊 **Community Stats - [Month]:**
- Total deals closed: $4.2M+
- Average deals per user: 12
- Most common win: "Follow-up reminder saved a $25k deal"
- Biggest single win: $340,000 deal closed

**Top Success Story:**

"I had a prospect in my pipeline for 6 months. Completely forgot about them. Axolop's AI flagged them as 're-engage candidate.' I sent one email. They called back same day. Closed $68,000." - Marcus T., Agency Owner

---

I'm not trying to make you feel bad.

But I am trying to make you think:

**What did YOU close this month? Would it have been different with Axolop?**

Your account data is still here. 60 more days before we delete it.

[Reactivate Your Account →]

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - Reply "WHAT CHANGED" and I'll tell you about the new features we launched since you left.
```

---

### Email 4: Final Notice (Day 75)

**Subject:** Deleting your account in 15 days

This is a courtesy notice.

In 15 days, we're deleting your Axolop account and all associated data.

This includes:
- Your contacts
- Your pipeline
- Your email templates
- Your automation workflows
- Your reports

Once it's gone, it's gone. We can't recover it.

**If you want to keep your data:**
Reply "SAVE IT" and we'll extend the hold for another 90 days.

**If you want to come back:**
Reply "I'M BACK" and I'll reactivate your account at your original pricing.

**If you're done:**
No action needed. We'll delete everything on [DATE].

No pressure. Just letting you know.

{{sender_name}}
```

## SEQUENCE 4: UPGRADE SEQUENCE (FREE → PAID)

**Trigger:** User on free tier for 30+ days
**Goal:** Convert free user to paid

---

### Email 1: Hitting Limits (Trigger: 80% of limits used)

**Subject:** You're about to run out of space, {{first_name}}

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

Your free Axolop account is almost full.

**Current usage:**
- Leads: {{lead_count}}/100 ({{lead_percentage}}% used)
- Contacts: {{contact_count}}/500 ({{contact_percentage}}% used)
- Forms: {{form_count}}/3 ({{form_percentage}}% used)

When you hit the limit, you won't be able to add new leads or contacts.

And let's be honest: if you're adding this many leads, your free tier is working. You're getting value.

Time to upgrade before you hit the wall.

**Deal Closer System - $49/month:**
- 1,000 leads (10x more)
- 5,000 contacts (10x more)
- 10 forms
- Email integration
- Calendar integration
- 5 workflow automations

[Upgrade to Deal Closer →]

Or, if you want the AI features that'll 10x your results:

**Revenue Accelerator - $99/month:**
- 10,000 leads (100x more)
- 50,000 contacts (100x more)
- AI Second Brain
- AI Lead Scoring
- AI Email Writer
- And 50+ more features

[Upgrade to Revenue Accelerator →]

Your choice. But don't wait until you can't add that next hot lead.

{{sender_name}}
```

### Email 2: Feature Tease (Day 45 of Free)

**Subject:** This feature has closed $2.4M for our users

**Body:**

```
{{first_name}},

There's a feature you don't have access to.

It's called **AI Lead Scoring.**

Here's what it does:
- Analyzes every lead in your pipeline
- Scores them 1-100 based on likelihood to close
- Tells you EXACTLY who to call first

Why does this matter?

**Story time:**

Jennifer runs an insurance agency. 200 leads in her pipeline. Limited time to call.

Before AI Lead Scoring: She'd call randomly. Hit rate: 8%.

After AI Lead Scoring: She calls the top 20 scored leads first. Hit rate: 34%.

**Same leads. Same time. 4x the results.**

Jennifer closed an extra $2.4M last year using this one feature.

You're leaving money on the table without it.

AI Lead Scoring is included in Revenue Accelerator ($99/month).
