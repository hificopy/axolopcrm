# AXOLOP CRM - COLD OUTREACH PLAYBOOK

> "The Rule of 100: Do 100 primary actions per day for 100 days straight."
> 100 messages × 100 days = 10,000 touchpoints = Inevitable success

---

## THE THREE Cs OF COLD OUTREACH

Every cold message must have:

1. **COMPLIMENT** - Genuine observation about them
2. **CREDIBILITY** - Why they should care about you
3. **CALL-TO-ACTION** - What you want them to do next

## LINKEDIN OUTREACH SCRIPTS

### Script 1: The Industry Expert (Best for B2B)

**Connection Request Note (300 chars max):**
```
{{first_name}}, saw your post about {{specific_topic}} - really resonated. I help {{industry}} agencies close 30% more deals using AI-powered CRM. Would love to connect and exchange insights.
```

**Follow-Up DM (After Accepted):**
```
{{first_name}},

Thanks for connecting!

Quick question: are you currently happy with your CRM situation, or is there room for improvement?

I ask because we've helped 50+ {{industry}} agencies go from "chaos spreadsheets" to "30% more closed deals" in 90 days.

Would you be open to a 2-minute Loom video showing exactly how it works? No pressure, just think it could help based on what I saw on your profile.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**If No Response (Day 3):**
```
Hey {{first_name}},

Following up - did my last message make sense?

I know LinkedIn DMs can feel spammy, so I'll be direct:

If you're losing deals because of poor follow-up (happens to everyone), Axolop fixes that.

If not, no worries - just say "not interested" and I'll stop bugging you.

Either way, happy to chat if you ever want to talk CRM strategy.

```

### Script 2: The Competitor Swap (Target: GoHighLevel Users)

**Connection Request Note:**
```
{{first_name}}, noticed you're in the GHL ecosystem. Built something that solves the complexity problem while saving $400/month. Happy to share if useful.
```

**Follow-Up DM:**
```
{{first_name}},

Thanks for connecting!

Noticed you're using GoHighLevel (saw it in your posts/website).

Quick question: How much time does your team spend fighting with the platform vs. actually closing deals?

We've helped 50+ agencies switch from GHL to Axolop:
- Same power, less complexity
- $99/mo vs $497/mo
- Free data migration
- AI that actually works

Interested in seeing a side-by-side comparison? I can record a quick video specific to your use case.

{{your_name}}
```

### Script 3: The Pain-First Approach

**Connection Request Note:**
```
{{first_name}}, ran across your profile researching {{industry}} agencies. Have a question about how you handle lead follow-up - curious about your process.
```

**Follow-Up DM:**
```
{{first_name}},

Thanks for connecting!

Quick question: When a lead goes cold, what's your system for bringing them back?

I ask because most agencies I talk to have the same problem:
- 100 leads in the pipeline
- 20 are hot, 30 are warm, 50 are "somewhere in there"
- No system to prioritize who to call
- Deals slip through the cracks

We built Axolop specifically to solve this. AI scores every lead 1-100 so you know EXACTLY who to call first.

Worth a quick demo to see if it could help?

### Script 4: The Social Proof Play

**Connection Request Note:**
```
{{first_name}}, just helped a {{industry}} agency close $47k extra last quarter. Thought you might find the strategy useful. Mind if I connect?
```

**Follow-Up DM:**
```
{{first_name}},

Thanks for the connection!

Story I thought you'd appreciate:

One of our clients, Sarah (marketing agency), was losing 2-3 deals per month because of poor follow-up. Classic problem.

We set her up on Axolop. AI handles the reminders. She hasn't lost a deal since.

Result: $47k extra in Q3 alone.

Would this kind of result be meaningful for your business?

If so, I'd love to show you exactly how we did it. No pitch, just the actual strategy.

## INSTAGRAM DM SCRIPTS

### The Warm-Up Sequence (Recommended)

**Before DM (Days 1-3):**
- Follow them
- Like 3-5 of their recent posts
- Leave 2-3 genuine comments (not "great post!" - actual value)
- Watch their stories, react occasionally

**Day 4 DM:**
```
Hey {{first_name}}!

Been following your content on {{topic}} - really valuable stuff.

Quick question: what tools do you use to manage your client pipeline? Always curious how successful {{industry}} people stay organized.
```

**Day 5 (After Response):**
```
Makes sense! {{acknowledge their answer}}

Reason I ask: I work with a CRM called Axolop that's helped a lot of {{industry}} people simplify things.

Our users close 30% more deals because the AI handles all the follow-up reminders.

Would you be open to checking out a 2-min demo? No pitch - just showing what's possible.
```

---

### Direct Approach (For Time-Sensitive Opportunities)

```
{{first_name}},

Saw your recent post about {{specific pain point they mentioned}}.

We actually built a solution for exactly that. It's called Axolop - AI-powered CRM that makes sure you never lose a deal to poor follow-up.

Would a 2-min video showing how it works be valuable?

Either way, love your content. Keep it up.

## COLD EMAIL SCRIPTS

### Template 1: The Problem-Solution Email

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Losing deals to poor follow-up, {{first_name}}?"
- "Quick question about {{company}}"
- "30% more deals in 90 days?"

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Quick question: How many deals did your team lose last quarter because someone forgot to follow up?

If the answer is "more than zero," you're not alone.

The average sales team loses $50k+ per year to missed follow-ups. Not because they're bad at sales - because their CRM doesn't help them.

That's why we built Axolop.

Our AI-powered CRM:
✅ Scores leads 1-100 so you know who to call first
✅ Auto-reminds you before deals go cold
✅ Writes follow-up emails for you (seriously)
✅ Replaces $1,500/month in tools for $99/month

We guarantee you'll close 30% more deals in 90 days - or we work for free until you do.

Worth a quick look?

Axolop CRM

P.S. - We also do free data migration from whatever you're using now. Zero switching cost.
```

### Template 2: The Case Study Email

**Subject Line Options:**
- "How Sarah closed $47k extra (and how you can too)"
- "Stole this from a marketing agency"
- "{{industry}} agency went from 5 to 15 deals/month"

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Quick story:

Sarah runs a marketing agency in Austin. Last year, she was closing about 5 deals per month.

Not bad, but she knew she was leaving money on the table.

Her problem? Leads were slipping through the cracks. Her team forgot to follow up. Hot prospects went cold.

She switched to Axolop in June.

90 days later:
- 15 deals per month (3x increase)
- $47k extra revenue
- 10+ hours saved per week on admin

The difference? Our AI handles the follow-up. Reminds her team who to call. Even writes the emails.

I'm not saying you'll get the same results. But what if you got HALF of them?

Worth a 15-min conversation?

[Calendly Link]

Best,
{{your_name}}

P.S. - Sarah's exact setup takes 10 minutes to build. Happy to show you.
```

---

### Template 3: The Competitor Comparison

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Tired of paying $497/mo for GoHighLevel?"
- "{{first_name}}, saw you're using [Competitor]"
- "Switch from GHL in 24 hours (we handle everything)"

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Noticed {{company}} is using GoHighLevel.

Quick question: Are you actually using all those features, or just paying for them?

I ask because 90% of GHL users I talk to use maybe 30% of the platform. But they're still paying $497/month.

We built Axolop for agencies who want the power without the bloat:
- All the CRM features you actually use
- AI that actually works (not just marketing)
- $99/month instead of $497/month
- Free migration (we move your data)

30-day guarantee: If you don't love it, switch back. We'll even help you re-migrate.

Worth a side-by-side demo?

[Calendly Link]

{{your_name}}

P.S. - One client saved $4,700/year switching from GHL. What would you do with an extra $4,700?
```

### Template 4: The Breakup Email (Final in Sequence)

**Subject Line:**
- "Should I stop emailing you?"
- "Closing your file, {{first_name}}"
- "One last thing before I go"

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

I've sent a few emails about Axolop.

You haven't responded. That's cool.

But I'm going to close your file in my CRM (yes, I use Axolop too).

Before I do - quick poll:

Reply with a number:
1 = "Not interested, stop emailing"
2 = "Interested but bad timing, check back in 3 months"
3 = "Actually, let's talk"

Either way, no hard feelings.

Thanks for reading.

{{your_name}}

P.S. - This email gets 40%+ response rate. Just saying.
```

## COLD CALL SCRIPTS

### The Gatekeeper Script

**Receptionist:**
"Hi, I'm trying to reach {{prospect_name}} in sales/marketing. Is this the right number?"

**If Asked Who You Are:**
"This is {{your_name}} from Axolop. We work with {{industry}} agencies on their CRM systems. They'll know what it's about."

**If Asked What It's Regarding:**
"I'm following up on something I sent over about closing more deals. It's a quick question - should take 30 seconds."

---

### The Cold Call Script (Prospect Answers)

```
"Hi {{first_name}}, this is {{your_name}} from Axolop. Did I catch you at a bad time?"

[If YES: "When's better?" - Get specific time, hang up, call back then]
[If NO: Continue]

"I'll be quick - 30 seconds.

We help {{industry}} agencies close 30% more deals using AI-powered CRM.

The reason I'm calling: I noticed you're using [current CRM/no CRM/spreadsheets] and wanted to see if you're happy with how you're tracking leads right now.

[Pause - Let Them Answer]

[If they're happy]: "Great! Mind if I ask what you like most about it?"
[Then]: "Makes sense. If you ever run into issues with [common pain point], we might be worth exploring. Can I send you a quick video showing what we do differently?"

[If they have pain]: "That's exactly what we hear a lot. Let me ask - what's that costing you? Lost deals? Time?"
[Then]: "Got it. We specifically built Axolop to solve that. Would you be open to a quick 15-min demo to see if we can help? I won't pitch you - just show you the platform and let you decide."

[If they're skeptical]: "Totally fair. What would need to be true for you to even consider looking at a new CRM?"
[Listen - Address their concern]

[Close]: "How about this - let me send you a 2-minute video showing exactly how it works. If it looks interesting, we can talk. If not, you've lost 2 minutes. Fair?"
```

---

### Objection Handling (Phone)

**"Send me some information"**
```
"I can do that. But honestly, most people who say that never look at it. What's really going on - is this just not a priority right now?"
[Pause - let them answer honestly]
[Then address the real objection]
```

**"We're already using [Competitor]"**
```
"Got it - what made you take this call then? Something not working?"
[Listen]
"That's exactly why agencies are switching to us. Would you be open to a side-by-side comparison?"
```

**"We don't have budget"**
```
"I hear you. Quick question though - what's losing one deal per month costing you? Because at $99/month, Axolop pays for itself if it helps you close just one extra deal per quarter."
```

**"I'm too busy"**
```
"Completely understand. When would be a better time to revisit this? I'm happy to call back."
[Get specific date/time]
[Add to calendar]
```

**"Just send me the pricing"**
```
"Sure - but the pricing won't make sense without context. How about a 10-minute call where I show you the platform, then I can send pricing that's actually relevant to your situation?"
```

Best of luck."
