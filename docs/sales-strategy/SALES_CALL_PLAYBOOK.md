## THE PERFECT SALES CALL STRUCTURE

**Total Time:** 45-60 minutes

| Phase | Time | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Rapport | 5 min | Build trust, human connection |
| Set Agenda | 2 min | Control the call, set expectations |
| Discovery | 20 min | Find pain, understand situation |
| Demo | 15 min | Show solution to THEIR problems |
| Objections | 10 min | Handle resistance |
| Close | 8 min | Get the commitment |

---

## PHASE 1: RAPPORT (5 Minutes)

### Opening Script

```
"Hey {{first_name}}! Thanks for jumping on. How's your [day/week] going so far?"

[Let them answer - mirror their energy]

"Awesome. Before we dive in, I have to ask - I saw on your LinkedIn that you're in {{city}}. How's the weather there?"

[Small talk - 2-3 minutes max]

"Perfect. Well, I'm excited to chat. I think there might be a good fit here, but we'll find out together."
```

### Rapport Tips

**DO:**
- Find common ground (city, industry, mutual connections)
- Match their energy level (upbeat = upbeat, calm = calm)
- Be genuine - people smell fake from a mile away
- Use their name 2-3 times in the first 5 minutes

**DON'T:**
- Rush past rapport (you'll pay for it in the close)
- Make it awkward (don't force connection)
- Talk about yourself too much
- Go longer than 5 minutes

---

## PHASE 2: SET AGENDA (2 Minutes)

### Agenda Script

```
"Alright {{first_name}}, here's how I like to run these calls - and stop me if this doesn't work for you:

First, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions about your current situation. Not to be nosy, but to see if we're actually a fit.

Then, if it makes sense, I'll show you exactly how Axolop works and how it could help.

After that, we'll decide together if it makes sense to move forward.

Fair?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- You're in control (they know what to expect)
- You've planted the idea of "moving forward"
- You've set up that there might NOT be a fit (takes pressure off)
- They agreed to the process

---

## PHASE 3: DISCOVERY (20 Minutes)

### The SPIN Framework

**S** - Situation Questions (understand current state)
**P** - Problem Questions (find the pain)
**I** - Implication Questions (make the pain worse)
**N** - Need-Payoff Questions (make them want the solution)

---

### Situation Questions (5 min)

**Purpose:** Understand their current state

```
"Walk me through your current sales process. How do you track leads right now?"

"What CRM are you using? [Or: Are you using any software to manage this?]"

"How many leads are you handling per month, roughly?"

"How big is your sales team?"

"What's working well about your current setup?"
```

**Notes:**
- Don't spend too long here
- Get the facts, move to problems
- Listen for hints of pain

---

### Problem Questions (5 min)

**Purpose:** Find the pain points

```
"What's the most frustrating part about your current system?"

"Have you ever lost a deal because someone forgot to follow up?"

"How often does that happen?"

"What happens when a lead falls through the cracks?"

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing about your sales process, what would it be?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Specific examples (stories)
- Emotional language (frustrated, annoying, hate)
- Frequency (always, every week, constantly)
- Cost (lost deals, lost money, lost time)

---

### Implication Questions (5 min)

**Purpose:** Make the pain worse (they need to FEEL it)

```
"You said you lose 2-3 deals per month to poor follow-up. What's your average deal size?"

[Wait for answer]

"So that's... $20-30k per month walking out the door? $240-360k per year?"

"How does that affect [their specific goal - growth, hiring, stress]?"

"What happens if you don't fix this in the next 6 months?"

"How does your team feel when they lose a deal they should have closed?"
```

**Key:** Let the silence sit. Let them FEEL the weight of the problem.

---

### Need-Payoff Questions (5 min)

**Purpose:** Make them want the solution (before you present it)

```
"If you never lost another deal to poor follow-up, what would that mean for your business?"

"If you could get 10 hours per week back from manual work, what would you do with that time?"

"What if you knew exactly which leads to call first, every single day?"

"If you could consolidate all your tools into one platform and save $1,000/month, where would that money go?"

"What does success look like for you in the next 90 days?"
```

**Key:** Make them paint the picture of success. Now they want it.

---

### Discovery Summary (1 min)

**Before moving to demo, summarize what you heard:**

```
"Okay {{first_name}}, let me make sure I got this right:

Right now you're using [current solution], which is costing you [pain point 1].

You're losing about [X deals/month] because [pain point 2].

That's about [$X/year] in lost revenue.

And your main goal is to [their stated goal].

Did I miss anything?"

[Let them confirm or add]

"Perfect. Let me show you exactly how Axolop solves this."
```

---

## PHASE 4: DEMO (15 Minutes)

### Demo Rules

**Rule #1:** Only show features that solve THEIR problems.
**Rule #2:** After each feature, ask "Does this solve [their problem]?"
**Rule #3:** Keep it short. 15 minutes max.
**Rule #4:** Let them talk. Ask questions throughout.

---

### Demo Structure

**Connect Each Feature to Their Pain:**

```
"You said you're losing deals because of poor follow-up. Here's how we solve that..."

[Show feature]

"See this? The AI scores every lead 1-100. You told me you have 200 leads and don't know who to call first. This tells you exactly who to call - RIGHT NOW."

[Show the score]

"Does this solve that problem for you?"

[Wait for answer - they should say yes]

"Great. Next problem you mentioned..."
```

---

### Feature-to-Problem Mapping

| Their Problem | Feature to Show | What to Say |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Losing deals to poor follow-up | AI reminders, lead scoring | "The AI flags deals before they go cold. You said you forgot to call Marcus. This would have reminded you." |
| Too many tools, too expensive | Dashboard, integrations | "This replaces your [list their tools]. One platform. One login. $99/month instead of $1,500." |
| Don't know who to call | AI lead scoring | "Every lead gets a score 1-100. Call the 90s first, nurture the 30s. Science, not guessing." |
| Emails take too long | AI email writer | "Click this button. Tell it what you need. Watch. [AI generates email] 5 seconds." |
| Team isn't on same page | Pipeline, activity tracking | "Everyone sees the same pipeline. Every call logged. No more 'did you call them?' conversations." |
| Data scattered everywhere | Contact 360 view | "Everything in one place. Emails, calls, notes, deals. Full history at a glance." |

---

### Demo Check-Ins

**After each major feature:**

```
"Does this make sense?"

"Can you see how this would help with [their specific problem]?"

"Any questions about this part?"

"On a scale of 1-10, how valuable is this for you?"
```

---

### Demo Close

```
"So that's Axolop in a nutshell.

Quick recap:
- AI lead scoring so you know who to call [solves their problem 1]
- Automatic follow-up reminders so you never forget [solves their problem 2]
- One platform replacing [their current tools] [solves their problem 3]

Questions so far?"
```

---

## PHASE 5: OBJECTION HANDLING (10 Minutes)

### The LAER Framework

**L** - Listen (let them finish completely)
**A** - Acknowledge (validate their concern)
**E** - Explore (understand the real objection)
**R** - Respond (address it with proof)

---

### Top 10 Objections & Responses

---

#### Objection 1: "It's too expensive"

**Listen:** [Let them explain]

**Acknowledge:**
"I totally get it. Budget matters. Let me ask you something..."

**Explore:**
"What are you comparing it to? Your current solution, or just the number itself?"

**Respond (if comparing to current):**
```
"You mentioned you're paying $497 for GoHighLevel, $97 for Calendly, and $500 for ActiveCampaign. That's $1,094/month.

Axolop is $99/month.

That's not a cost. That's $995/month in savings."
```

**Respond (if just the number):**
```
"What's your average deal size? $5,000?

What if Axolop helps you close just ONE more deal per month?

$5,000 in revenue for $99 investment.

That's a 5,000% ROI.

And if it doesn't work? We guarantee 30% more deals in 90 days or we work for free until you hit it."
```

---

#### Objection 2: "I need to think about it"

**Listen:** [Let them explain]

**Acknowledge:**
"Absolutely! This is a big decision. I want you to be 100% sure."

**Explore:**
```
"Help me understand - what specifically do you need to think about?

Is it the price?
Is it the features?
Is it the timing?
Or is there something else I haven't addressed?"
```

**Respond (based on real objection):**
[Address whatever they actually say]

**If they won't share:**
```
"I'm going to be honest with you, {{first_name}}.

In my experience, 'I need to think about it' usually means there's something I haven't addressed.

If there's a concern you haven't mentioned, I'd rather talk about it now than have you leave with doubts.

What's really going on?"
```

---

#### Objection 3: "I need to talk to my partner/team"

**Acknowledge:**
"Makes total sense. You want everyone aligned."

**Explore:**
```
"Who else needs to be part of this decision?

What questions do you think they'll have?

Are they available to join a quick call so we can answer questions together?"
```

**Respond:**
```
"Here's what I'd suggest:

Let's schedule a call with [partner/team] for [specific time].

I'll do a condensed demo, answer their questions, and we can make a decision together.

Does Thursday at 2pm work?"
```

**Alternative (if they refuse):**
```
"Okay, no problem.

Can I send you a 5-minute video summary that covers everything we discussed?

You can share it with [partner], and then you two can discuss.

What's the best email for them?"
```

---

#### Objection 4: "We're already using [Competitor]"

**Acknowledge:**
"Got it. [Competitor] is solid. Let me ask..."

**Explore:**
```
"What made you take this call then?

Is there something about [Competitor] that's not quite working?

What would need to be true for you to consider switching?"
```

**Respond (GoHighLevel specific):**
```
"GoHighLevel is powerful, but here's what I hear from agencies who switch:

1. It's complex - your team spends more time learning than selling
2. It's expensive - $497/month vs our $99/month
3. The AI features are... limited

We'll even migrate your data for free. Zero switching cost.

Would a side-by-side comparison be helpful?"
```

**Respond (HubSpot specific):**
```
"HubSpot is great for enterprise. But for agencies?

You're paying $1,800/month for features you don't use.
The AI features are add-ons that cost extra.
And their support? Good luck getting anyone on the phone.

Axolop is purpose-built for agencies.
$99/month. AI included. Actual humans who answer.

Worth exploring?"
```

---

#### Objection 5: "I don't have time to learn a new CRM"

**Acknowledge:**
"I hear that all the time. Learning new software is a pain."

**Explore:**
"How much time are you spending right now on [manual task they mentioned]?"

**Respond:**
```
"You told me you spend 10+ hours per week on admin work.

Axolop setup takes 10 minutes.
Our onboarding gets you productive in one call.
After that? You're saving those 10 hours every week.

10 minutes of learning for 10 hours of saving.

The time investment pays off in Week 1."
```

---

#### Objection 6: "Can you send me some information?"

**Acknowledge:**
"I can definitely do that."

**Explore:**
```
"I'll be honest though - most people who ask for information never look at it.

Is there something about what I showed you that didn't land?

Or is this just not a priority right now?"
```

**Respond:**
```
"Here's what I'll do:

I'll send you a personalized video recap of everything we discussed - specific to your situation.

It'll be 5 minutes.

If you watch it and still have questions, let's schedule a follow-up call.

But if you're genuinely interested, let's just lock in a time now while we're both here.

How about [specific time]?"
```

---

#### Objection 7: "I've been burned by CRMs before"

**Acknowledge:**
"That's fair. Bad CRM experiences are frustrating."

**Explore:**
```
"What happened? What specifically didn't work?

Was it the software itself, the implementation, or the support?"
```

**Respond:**
```
"I appreciate you sharing that.

Here's what's different with Axolop:

1. We do the migration FOR you - you don't have to figure it out
2. You get a dedicated onboarding person - not chatbots
3. Our guarantee: 30% more deals in 90 days or we work for free

If we fail you, we work until we fix it. No extra charge.

That's not something [previous CRM] offered, right?"
```

---

#### Objection 8: "The timing isn't right"

**Acknowledge:**
"I respect that. Timing matters."

**Explore:**
```
"What would need to change for the timing to be right?

Is there a specific date or event you're waiting for?

What happens if you wait 3 months to solve [their pain point]?"
```

**Respond:**
```
"I hear you. But let me share something:

Every month you wait, you're losing [X deals] to poor follow-up.

That's [$$$/month] walking out the door.

In 3 months, that's [$$$ × 3].

The timing will never feel 'perfect.'

But the deals you're losing right now? Those are real."
```

---

#### Objection 9: "I'm not the decision maker"

**Acknowledge:**
"No problem. Who makes the final call?"

**Explore:**
```
"What's their role?

What criteria do they use to make decisions like this?

Are they available for a quick call?"
```

**Respond:**
```
"Here's what I'd suggest:

Let me send you a one-page summary you can share with [decision maker].

Then, let's schedule a call with them included.

I'll give a quick 10-minute recap and answer their questions directly.

What time works for both of you?"
```

---

#### Objection 10: "I want to try the free plan first"

**Acknowledge:**
"Smart. Nothing wrong with testing it out."

**Explore:**
"What specifically are you trying to evaluate?"

**Respond:**
```
"Here's my honest take:

The free plan gives you a taste, but it's limited.

You won't get the AI lead scoring.
You won't get the email automation.
You won't get the real experience.

And frankly? You'll judge Axolop on 20% of its capabilities.

Here's a better option:

Start the 14-day free trial of Revenue Accelerator.
Full access. All features. No credit card required.

If you don't love it, downgrade to free.

But at least you'll know what you're actually evaluating."
```

---

## PHASE 6: CLOSE (8 Minutes)

### Trial Close

```
"{{first_name}}, on a scale of 1-10, how good of a fit does this feel?"
```

**If 8-10:**
```
"Awesome! Sounds like we should move forward.

Let me walk you through the next steps..."
```

**If 5-7:**
```
"Okay, a 6. That's honest.

What would make this a 10 for you?"

[Handle whatever they say]
```

**If 1-4:**
```
"I appreciate the honesty.

Sounds like maybe this isn't the right fit right now.

What would need to change for this to make sense?"

[Either uncover the real objection or gracefully exit]
```

---

### The Direct Close

```
"Based on everything we talked about, here's what I recommend:

The Revenue Accelerator at $99/month.

You get:
- AI lead scoring so you know who to call
- Unlimited email automation
- All the features we just walked through
- Done-for-you migration (we move your data)
- 90-day onboarding support

And our guarantee: Close 30% more deals in 90 days or we work for free.

Let's get you started. I'll send the link right now."
```

---

### The Assumptive Close

```
"Great! I'm excited for you.

Here's what happens next:

1. I'm going to send you the signup link right now
2. You'll create your account - takes 2 minutes
3. We'll schedule your kickoff call for tomorrow or Wednesday

Which works better for you - tomorrow at 2pm or Wednesday at 10am?"
```

---

### The Urgency Close

```
"Quick thing I should mention:

Our founding member pricing at $99/month is almost gone.

We only had 50 spots at this price. Last I checked, there were 7 left.

Once they're gone, the price goes to $149/month.

If you want to lock in $99/month forever, we should get you started today.

Ready?"
```

---

### The Risk Reversal Close

```
"I know you might still have some hesitation. Let me remove all the risk.

Here's our guarantee:

Close 30% more deals in 90 days - or we work with you for FREE until you do.

You keep all the bonuses even if you cancel.

If you're not happy for ANY reason in the first 30 days, we'll refund you 100%.

There's literally no risk to trying this.

What do you say?"
```

---

### After They Say Yes

```
"Awesome! Welcome to Axolop!

I'm going to send you the signup link right now.

[Send link via email while on call]

Do you see it? Perfect.

Go ahead and create your account while we're on the phone. I'll wait.

[They sign up]

You're in! Here's what happens next:

1. Check your inbox - you'll get a welcome email in about 60 seconds
2. Our success team will reach out within 24 hours to schedule your kickoff
3. They'll handle your data migration and get your pipeline set up

3 = "Actually, let's do this"

Either way, no hard feelings.

## CALL RECORDING & REVIEW

### What to Track

After every call, record:
- [ ] Did I build rapport? (Rating 1-10)
- [ ] Did I complete full discovery? (Y/N)
- [ ] Did I tie demo to their specific pains? (Y/N)
- [ ] What objections came up?
- [ ] How did I handle them?
- [ ] Did I close? (Y/N)
- [ ] If no, why not?
- [ ] What could I do better?

### Weekly Review

Listen to 2-3 calls per week. Focus on:
- Discovery quality (did I ask the right questions?)
- Objection handling (could I have done better?)
- Close attempts (did I actually ask for the sale?)
- Talk ratio (was I listening more than talking?)
