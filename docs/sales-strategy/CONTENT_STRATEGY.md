### Content Templates (LinkedIn)

**Template 1: The Story Post**

```
[HOOK - 1 line that stops the scroll]

[SETUP - 2-3 lines about the situation]

[CONFLICT - What went wrong?]

[LESSON - What I learned]

[CTA - Question or action]

---

[Signature/hashtags]
```

**Example:**
```
I lost a $47,000 deal last year because I forgot to call.

The prospect was perfect. Big budget. Ready to buy.
We shook hands at a conference.
I said, "I'll call you Monday."

Monday came. Client emergency.
Tuesday came. Another fire.
Wednesday... I forgot.

Two weeks later, I finally called.
"Oh, we already signed with someone else."

$47k. Gone.

Now I use AI to remind me before deals go cold.
Haven't lost one since.

What's the biggest deal you've ever lost? ↓

**Template 2: The Tactical Post**

```
[HOOK - Promise a specific outcome]

Here's how to [achieve outcome] in [timeframe]:

Step 1: [Action]
→ [Explanation]

Step 2: [Action]
→ [Explanation]

Step 3: [Action]
→ [Explanation]

[Optional: Screenshot/visual]

[CTA]

[Signature/hashtags]
```

**Example:**
```
How to never lose a deal to poor follow-up again (5-minute fix):

Step 1: Score every lead 1-100
→ Based on engagement, company size, buying signals
→ Call 80+ scores first, nurture 40-79, archive <40

Step 2: Set auto-reminders at key stages
→ Day 1: Send proposal
→ Day 3: Follow up if no response
→ Day 7: Second follow-up
→ Day 14: Breakup email

Step 3: Template your emails
→ Don't write from scratch every time
→ AI can write them now (seriously)

This system recovered $23k in "lost" deals for one of our users.

What's your follow-up system? ↓

**Template 3: The Contrarian Post**

```
[HOT TAKE - Controversial statement]

Here's why:

[Reason 1]

[Reason 2]

[Reason 3]

But here's what actually works:

[Your solution/alternative]

Agree? Disagree? Fight me in the comments ↓
```

**Example:**
```
Most CRMs are designed to confuse you. On purpose.

Here's why:

1. Complex = "Enterprise-ready" marketing
2. More features = higher prices
3. Confusion = more support tickets = more "touchpoints"

They don't WANT you to figure it out easily.

But here's the truth: A CRM should take 5 minutes to set up.
Not 5 hours.
Not 5 days.
Not a "dedicated implementation team."

If your CRM needs an implementation team, it's too complicated.

Agree? ↓
```

**Template 4: The Social Proof Post**

```
[RESULT - Specific metric/outcome]

Here's how [Name] did it:

**The Problem:**
[Their situation before]

**The Change:**
[What they did differently]

**The Result:**
[Specific outcome with numbers]

[Screenshot or quote]

What's stopping YOU from getting the same result?

### Twitter/X (Thought Leadership)

**Posting Schedule:** 3 tweets per day

**Thread Thursday:** One long-form thread per week

**Tweet Types:**
1. Observations ("I noticed that...")
2. Lessons ("Here's what I learned...")
3. Hot takes ("Unpopular opinion:...")
4. Questions ("What's your biggest challenge with...")
5. Quotes/stats ("90% of deals are lost because...")

**Example Tweets:**
```
"CRM" stands for Customer Relationship Management.

Most CRMs are great at "management."
Terrible at "relationship."

That's backwards.
```

```
You don't need a better sales process.

You need a system that makes it impossible to forget follow-ups.

The process is fine. The execution is the problem.
```

```
Price of GoHighLevel: $497/mo
Price of Axolop: $99/mo
Price of losing a deal because you forgot to follow up: ???

The math isn't hard.
```
