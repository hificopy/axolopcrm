# COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

## Our Positioning Statement

**For** agency owners and SMB sales teams **who** are overwhelmed by tool fragmentation **Axolop** is an all-in-one CRM **that** combines sales, marketing, and AI knowledge management **unlike** GoHighLevel which is complex and expensive **our product** is simpler, 3x cheaper, and uniquely intelligent.

## Differentiation Strategy

### Where We Win (Double Down)

1. **Price** - $99 vs $297 (GoHighLevel)

   - Marketing: "The only CRM that learns your business"
   - Target: Knowledge workers, consultants

   - Target: Non-technical users

4. **Modern Tech** - Faster, cleaner, better UX

   - Target: Design-conscious users

### Where We Compete (Match Parity)

1. Mobile app (must have)
2. SMS/WhatsApp (must have for agencies)
3. Zapier (enterprise requirement)
4. Workflows unlocked (already built!)

### Where We Concede (Don't Compete)

1. White label (GoHighLevel's moat, expensive to build)
2. Membership sites (ClickFunnels niche)
3. Full website builder (not our core)
