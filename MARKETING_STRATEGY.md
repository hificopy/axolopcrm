## Core Messaging Pillars

### Pillar 1: "Tool Graveyard"
> You're paying $1,375/month to 10 different apps that don't talk to each other. That's not a tech stack, that's a cry for help.

### Pillar 2: "Agency Life Understood"
> We know you're manually copying data between tabs at 2am because Zapier broke again. We built the cure.

### Pillar 3: "Money Printer"
> Save $1,096/month. That's $13,152/year. That's a vacation. That's payroll. That's your sanity.

### Pillar 4: "AI That Actually Works"
> Not another chatbot that hallucinates. A second brain that actually remembers your SOPs.

# PART 2: X/TWITTER STRATEGY

## Account: @AxolopCRM

### Tone: Unhinged Tech Startup Energy
Think: Duolingo owl met a tired agency owner at 3am

### Tweet Categories

---

## CATEGORY 1: CONTROVERSIAL HOT TAKES (Viral Potential: HIGH)

### Format: Bold statement + mic drop

**Tweet 1:**
```
HubSpot charges $1,800/month to tell you what you already know.

We charge $279/month to tell you what you don't.

Different breed.
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Controversial take:

If you're paying for GoHighLevel AND ClickUp AND Notion AND Calendly...

You don't have a "tech stack."

You have commitment issues.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Agency owners be like "I need another tool"

No bestie you need ONE tool that doesn't suck
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Salesforce is what happens when you let engineers design a product for salespeople

Nobody asked for 47 dashboards
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Unpopular opinion:

Your CRM isn't the problem.

Having 10 CRMs is the problem.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
Y'all really out here paying:
- $497 GoHighLevel
- $400 HubSpot
- $299 Zapier
- $199 Databox
- $79 Monday
- $59 Typeform
- $20 Calendly

That's $1,553/month

We're $279

Math is math
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Every agency owner has that one client folder with:
- notes_final.doc
- notes_final_v2.doc
- notes_FINAL_FINAL.doc
- notes_USE_THIS_ONE.doc

We fixed this btw
```

---

## CATEGORY 2: RELATABLE PAIN POINTS (Engagement: HIGH)

### Format: "Me when..." / POV style

**Tweet 8:**
```
POV: You're an agency owner explaining to your client why their project is in 4 different apps

"So the tasks are in ClickUp but the docs are in Notion and the emails are in HubSpot and the invoices are in QuickBooks and the—"

Client: *leaves*
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Agency owners at 2am:

"I just need ONE more integration to fix everything"

*creates 47th Zapier connection*

*it breaks immediately*
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
"Why are you so tired?"

*stares in 10 browser tabs of different SaaS products*
```

**Tweet 11:**
```
Things that cost less than your current tech stack:

- New MacBook Pro
- 6 months of rent in some cities
- A used car
- Our entire CRM for 5 years
```

**Tweet 12:**
```
The agency owner starter pack:

- 47 open Chrome tabs
- GoHighLevel withdrawal symptoms
- A Notion dashboard nobody uses
- "We should consolidate tools" said every quarterly meeting
- $1,500/month tool anxiety
```

---

## CATEGORY 3: PRODUCT FLEXES (Conversion: MEDIUM-HIGH)

### Format: Feature reveal with attitude

**Tweet 13:**
```
Wild concept:

What if your CRM, project management, knowledge base, forms, email, calendar, and AI assistant were... the same app?

Crazy I know

Anyway we built it
```

**Tweet 14:**
```
Our customers save $1,096/month on average

That's not marketing speak

That's $13,152/year

That's "I can finally hire another person" money
```

**Tweet 15:**
```
Features we have that others charge extra for:

- AI assistant: included
- Form builder: included
- Email marketing: included
- Calendar booking: included
- White-label reports: included

Features we charge extra for:

- Nothing lol
```

**Tweet 16:**
```
GoHighLevel: "We do everything!"
*requires 20 external integrations*

Us: "We do everything"
*actually does everything*
```

## CATEGORY 4: EDUCATIONAL THREADS (Value: HIGH)

### Thread 1: "The Great SaaS Consolidation"
```
Thread: Why 2025 is the year agencies stop paying for 10+ tools

I've talked to 100+ agency owners this year.

They all have the same problem.

Here's what I learned:

🧵 (1/8)
---
Most agencies are paying between $1,200-$2,000/month on tools.

Not because they need to.

Because nobody told them there was another way.

(2/8)
---
The average agency tech stack:

- CRM: $400-500/mo
- Project management: $50-100/mo
- Knowledge base: $30-50/mo
- Email marketing: $200-500/mo
- Forms: $50-100/mo
- Scheduling: $20-50/mo
- Automations: $100-300/mo
- Reporting: $100-200/mo

(3/8)
---
And here's the kicker:

None of these tools talk to each other natively.

So you ALSO need:
- Zapier: $100-300/mo
- Make: $50-100/mo
- Custom development: priceless

(4/8)
---
The real cost isn't just money.

It's:
- Context switching between 10 tabs
- Data living in 10 different places
- Onboarding team members to 10 different tools
- 10 different passwords to manage

(5/8)
---
We built Axolop because we lived this.

One platform. Everything connected natively.

CRM + Projects + Knowledge Base + Forms + Email + Calendar + AI.

$279/month.

(6/8)
---
The math is simple:

$1,500/month in tools → $279/month

That's $14,652/year back in your pocket.

That's a salary. That's growth. That's breathing room.

(7/8)
---
If you're still duct-taping 10 tools together in 2025...

This is your sign to consolidate.

Link in bio.

Or don't. Keep paying HubSpot to send automated birthday emails.

Your choice.

(8/8)
```

---

## CATEGORY 5: FOUNDER/BUILDER CONTENT

**Tweet 17:**
```
Built Axolop because I was tired of paying $1,500/month for tools that hate each other

Now agencies save $13k/year

Sometimes anger is a good business strategy
```

**Tweet 18:**
```
Day 1: "We'll just use a few tools"
Day 365: *has 47 subscriptions*
Day 730: *discovers Axolop*
Day 731: "Why didn't I do this sooner"
```

# PART 3: INSTAGRAM STRATEGY - @JUANSBIZ

## Personal Brand: The Agency Profit Expert

### Tone: Authority + Controversy + Real Talk
Think: Alex Hormozi's frameworks + Gary Vee's energy + actual agency experience

---

## REEL CONCEPTS (BOF - Bottom of Funnel)

### Reel 1: "The $1,375/month lie"
**Hook:** "You're probably wasting $1,375 every single month and you don't even know it"

**Script:**
```
[Face to camera, walking]

"You're probably wasting $1,375 every single month.

Here's what I mean.

GoHighLevel - $497
ClickUp - $50
Notion - $30
Miro - $50
Calendly - $97
ActiveCampaign - $500
Plus whatever else you're using

That's over $1,200 minimum.

And none of these tools talk to each other.

So you're ALSO paying for Zapier.

AND you're losing hours every week switching between tabs.

There's a better way.

One platform. Everything connected. $279/month.

Link in bio."
```

### Reel 2: "Why your agency isn't profitable"
**Hook:** "If your agency isn't hitting 40% profit margins, it's probably your tools"

**Script:**
```
[Sitting at desk]

"Most agencies run at 15-25% profit margins.

The best ones hit 40%+.

The difference?

The profitable ones aren't paying $1,500/month for 10 tools that don't work together.

They consolidated.

One CRM.
One project management.
One knowledge base.
One email system.
One billing system.

All connected.

Stop bleeding money to SaaS.

The link is in my bio."
```

### Reel 3: "The awkward client conversation"
**Hook:** "POV: Explaining to a client why their project updates are in 4 different apps"

**Script:**
```
[Acting out conversation]

CLIENT: "Hey where can I see the project status?"

YOU: "So the tasks are in ClickUp..."

CLIENT: "Okay"

YOU: "But the documents are in Notion..."

CLIENT: "Uh huh"

YOU: "And the emails are in HubSpot..."

CLIENT: "..."

YOU: "And the invoices are in QuickBooks..."

CLIENT: "Is there a simpler way?"

YOU: *stares at camera*

"There is now. Link in bio."
```

### Reel 4: "I cancelled 8 subscriptions in one day"
**Hook:** "I just cancelled $1,200/month in subscriptions. Here's what I replaced them with."

### Reel 5: "The real reason agencies fail"
**Hook:** "87% of agencies fail. It's not because they can't get clients."

---

## CAROUSEL CONCEPTS

### Carousel 1: "10 Tools You're Overpaying For"
Slide 1: "10 tools you're overpaying for (and the one that replaces them all)"
Slides 2-11: Each tool with cost and what it does
Slide 12: "Or just use Axolop for $279/month"

### Carousel 2: "Agency Tech Stack Audit"
Slide 1: "How to audit your agency tech stack in 10 minutes"
Slides 2-10: Audit questions and red flags
Slide 11: CTA

### Carousel 3: "The $13,152 Calculation"
Show the math of annual savings

---

## STORY CONTENT STRATEGY

### Daily Stories Template:
- **Morning:** Behind the scenes / Day in the life
- **Midday:** Quick tip or hot take
- **Afternoon:** Social proof / Testimonial
- **Evening:** Engagement question or poll

### Story Series Ideas:
1. "Tool of the Week I'm Cancelling"
2. "Client Win Wednesday"
3. "SaaS Roast Sunday"

# PART 4: AXOLOPCRM SOCIAL (BRAND ACCOUNT)

## Platform: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts

### Tone: Duolingo/Brita Shark Energy
Unhinged, weird, memorable, but still communicates value

---

## VIDEO CONCEPTS

### Video 1: "The Intervention"
**Concept:** Friends staging an intervention for someone's SaaS addiction

```
[Friends sitting in circle, one person enters]

FRIEND 1: "We need to talk about your subscriptions."

VICTIM: "What do you mean?"

FRIEND 2: *holds up credit card statement*
"47 SaaS subscriptions, Karen."

VICTIM: "I need them for my business!"

FRIEND 3: "You have THREE project management tools."

VICTIM: "They do different things!"

FRIEND 1: *slides Axolop across table*
"This does all of them."

VICTIM: *breaks down crying*
"I've been living a lie"
```

### Video 2: "The Breakup"
**Concept:** Breaking up with your old CRM like it's a toxic relationship

```
[Sitting across from laptop with HubSpot open]

"We need to talk."

*HubSpot logo on screen*

"It's not you, it's... actually it IS you."

"You charge $1,800/month and you can't even send a decent email."

"I found someone new. They do everything you do."

"For $279."

*closes laptop*

"Don't call me."
```

### Video 3: "The Tool Hoarding Documentary"
**Concept:** Nature documentary style narration

```
[Camera panning across screen with dozens of tabs open]

NARRATOR (David Attenborough voice):
"Here we observe the agency owner in their natural habitat."

"Notice the 47 browser tabs. Each one a different subscription."

"They have developed a remarkable ability to context-switch between 10 different tools..."

"While remembering none of their passwords."

"Scientists estimate this species spends $1,500/month on this behavior."

"There is hope, however..."

*shows Axolop*

"A new species has emerged."
```

### Video 4: "First Day at the Agency"
**Concept:** New employee overwhelmed by tech stack

```
BOSS: "Welcome! Let me show you our tools."

NEW HIRE: "Great!"

BOSS: "Tasks are in ClickUp. Docs in Notion. CRM is HubSpot. Emails in Mailchimp. Calendar in Calendly. Forms in Typeform. Chat in Slack. Video in Zoom. Notes in Evernote. Storage in Dropbox."

NEW HIRE: "..."

BOSS: "Oh and here's your list of 47 passwords."

NEW HIRE: *walks out*

[Cut to same scene]

BOSS: "Welcome! Here's Axolop."

NEW HIRE: "That's it?"

BOSS: "That's it."

NEW HIRE: "I love it here."
```

### Video 5: "The Password Reset Spiral"
**Concept:** The infinite loop of forgotten passwords

```
[Person at computer]

"Just need to check the CRM real quick"

*forgot password*

"Okay, email for reset..."

*forgot email password*

"Okay, phone verification..."

*phone is dead*

"Okay, authenticator app..."

*deleted it*

[Text on screen: "4 hours later"]

*still resetting passwords*

[Axolop logo]
"One login. Everything works."
```

### Video 6: "The Meeting That Could've Been An Email"
**Concept:** Exaggerated meeting to explain how to find a file

```
"Okay so the client wants to see the report."

"Is it in Google Drive?"

"No, Dropbox."

"Which folder?"

"2024 > Clients > Active > Wait no > 2023 > Archive > Actually..."

[15 minutes later]

"Found it! It's in my downloads."

[Axolop logo]
"Universal search. 2 seconds."
```

- "You made the right choice. Here's proof."

**Body:**
```
Hey {first_name},

You just did something 80% of agency owners are too scared to do.

You decided to stop throwing money at 10 different tools that hate each other.

Here's what happens next:

1. You'll save an average of $1,096/month
2. Your team will stop context-switching between 47 tabs
3. You'll actually know where your client data lives

Wild concept, I know.

Over the next few days, I'll show you exactly how to get the most out of Axolop.

But first, a question:

What's the ONE thing you're most excited to consolidate?

- [ ] CRM chaos
- [ ] Project management mess
- [ ] Email marketing madness
- [ ] All of the above (be honest)

Hit reply. I read every one.

Welcome to sanity,
The Axolop Team

P.S. - Your old tools are going to send you "we miss you" emails. Stay strong.
```

### Email 2: "The $13,152 you're about to save"
**Subject Lines:**
- "Let's do the math real quick"
- "This is what $13,152/year looks like"

- "Most people miss this"
- "Hidden in plain sight"

### Email 4: "Your first win"

- "You're different now"
- "The transformation is complete"

## NURTURE SEQUENCE (Leads who haven't converted)

### Email 1: "Still thinking about it?"
**Subject Lines:**
- "Your tools are talking about you behind your back"
- "Still paying for 10 subscriptions?"
- "Quick math problem for you"

**Body:**
```
Hey {first_name},

Quick question:

How much did you spend on SaaS last month?

If you had to think about it, the answer is "too much."

Here's what most agency owners pay:

- GoHighLevel: $497
- HubSpot: $400+
- Zapier: $100-300
- ClickUp: $50
- Notion: $30
- Calendly: $20
- Typeform: $50
- Various others: $200+

Total: $1,347-1,547/month

Axolop: $279/month

I'm not saying you should switch.

But I AM saying you should at least see what you're missing.

[Book a 15-minute demo →]

No pressure. Just clarity.

Cheers,
The Axolop Team

# PART 9: COMPETITOR POSITIONING

## How We Talk About Competitors

### HubSpot
**Our angle:** Overpriced, overcomplicated, overkill for agencies
**Line:** "HubSpot is great if you enjoy paying $1,800/month for features you'll never use"

### GoHighLevel
**Our angle:** Good concept, but still requires bolt-ons
**Line:** "GHL promised to replace everything. You're still using 5 other tools, aren't you?"

### Salesforce
**Our angle:** Enterprise dinosaur, not built for agencies
**Line:** "Salesforce is what happens when you need 10 consultants to use your CRM"

### ClickUp/Monday/Asana
**Our angle:** Great for project management, but now you need 5 more tools
**Line:** "Awesome! Now where's your CRM? And email? And forms? And..."

### Notion
**Our angle:** Beautiful, but not a CRM
**Line:** "We love Notion. It's just not a CRM, no matter how many templates you download"

## Comparison Framework

When comparing, always:
1. Acknowledge competitor strengths
2. Point out the gap we fill
3. Show the cost difference
4. Never lie or exaggerate
